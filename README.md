# Coltz's Ticket Bot

This is a **open source** ticket bot coded by Coltz for anyone to use.
Using `Discord.js` and `MongoDB`.

# Bot Set Up

To set this bot up you will need to go into the file named `config.json`
and provide a few things:
 - Ticket reaction message channel id
 - Ticket category id (optional)
 - Discord Bot Token
 - MongoDB connection url

## Discord Setup

First thing you want to do is create your ticket reaction channel. Call it anything you want.
Then in that channel send a message called something along the lines of  `create-your-ticket-here`
but you can call it what ever you want, and react with the emoji 🎫 

## Ending Result

You have a category named `TICKETS` where all your created tickets will be added, you have a channel named something along the lines of `create-your-ticket-here`, however call it what you like, and you send a message and react with 🎫.
